> **My Philosophy:** Data should be three things: **effective** (it actually works), **attractive** (people want to use it), and **impactful** (it makes a real difference).

I specialize in finding hidden patterns in healthcare data—particularly in areas where traditional analysis fails. My work focuses on closing the gender gap in health data through advanced statistical methods and ethical AI development.

## What I'm Working On

I spend my days wrestling with messy healthcare data, building AI systems that actually work in hospitals (harder than it sounds), and trying to make compliance frameworks less painful for everyone involved. Currently obsessed with a method I developed called Serendipity Finder—it finds correlations hiding in the extremes of data that everyone else ignores. In testing, it discovered 14 hidden patterns that traditional statistics completely missed. Still amazed it worked.

## About the Serendipity Finder

[![View Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/View%20Project-GitHub-FFE4E1?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=666)](https://github.com/Cazzy-Aporbo/Serendipity-Finder)

My favorite recent project—a statistical methodology for discovering correlations that only emerge in distribution extremes. Traditional analysis said "no correlation" (r < 0.06), but in the tails, correlations reached 0.85+. It's the kind of thing that makes you rethink how we analyze data.

**Real applications:**
- Financial risk (dependencies during market stress)
- Drug safety (side effects in specific subgroups)
- Climate science (tipping points)
- Manufacturing (failure patterns in extreme conditions)

The code is open-source because good ideas should be shared.

## Why I Do This Work

Healthcare AI has a representation problem. Most medical research historically excluded women, and AI trained on biased data perpetuates these gaps. At FoXX Health, I'm working to fix this—building comprehensive healthcare models that represent women's health accurately.

It's challenging work. Healthcare data is messy, regulations are complex, and stakes are high. But when you build something that helps identify a condition years earlier, or prevents an adverse reaction, or simply makes someone feel heard by the healthcare system—that's worth the late nights debugging.
