# Hi, I'm Cazzy

**Head of Data at [FoXX Health](https://www.foxxhealth.com)**
M.S. in Data Science, University of Denver
Certificate in AI in Healthcare from Johns Hopkins 2025

With a strong academic foundation in data science and advanced training in AI in Healthcare from Johns Hopkins, I bridge technical rigor with applied innovation in healthcare AI. I design systems that are intelligent, transparent, and aligned with healthcare compliance. My work spans machine learning engineering, LLM research, and building whole-body healthcare app to close the gender gap in health data.
